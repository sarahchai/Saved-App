# Saved App

### Summary

For my capstone project in my graduate program, I created a full-stack application called “Saved” that the user can catalog and send their saved items to another user. We get recommendations through words, texts, social media, ads, etc. We also find stuff to save online daily, but having them on several platforms makes it hard to look up when needed. I implemented three categories: movies, books, and places, but the final goal is to have various categories and let the user save everything in one app.
